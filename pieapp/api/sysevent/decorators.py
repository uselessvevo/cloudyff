    Method decorator used to handle emitted plugins' signals
    To use this decorator you need to define a signal in the plugin and emit it manually

    The methods that use this decorator must have the following signature: * `def method(self, target, event): ...`
    when observing multiple plugins or all plugins that were listed as dependencies

        * target (Optional[str]): Name of the requested plugins whose availability triggers the method
        * event (str): Name of the signal without `sig_` prefix

    Returns:
        * func(callable): The same method that was given as input.
